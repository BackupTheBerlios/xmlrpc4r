= ChangeLog for xmlrpc4r

:1.6.9 
* improved HttpServer (used for standalone server)

:1.6.8 (2001-07-06)
* added server-side support for mod_ruby (XMLRPC::ModRubyServer)
* added Service::PublicInstanceMethodsInterface, or short form with method XMLRPC::iPIMethods, which 
  allows to add all instance methods of a class as handlers to a server 
* added Service::Interface class (or method XMLRPC::interface) and a third
  form of BasicServer#add_handler(interface, obj)

:1.6.7 (2001-07-02)
* Client: added two new constructors: 
  * Client.new2(uri, proxy=nil, timeout=nil)
  * Client.new3(hash={})
* Client: added read-timeout (method timeout/timeout=)
* Client: added asynchronous methods: call_async, call2_async, multicall_async, mutlicall2_async, proxy_async, proxy2_async
* Client: if user/password specified sends every time a Authorization header (Basic), do not check WWW-Authentificate header. 
* includes new version of GServer.rb which fixed two minor logging-misbehaviours

:1.6.6 (2001-06-25)
* added Client-interface wrapper for SandStorm component architecture (see SourceForge.net).
  See file samples/sandstorm/active.rb
* added Basic HTTP (401) Authorization to Client and support for SSL.
    Client#new(host, url, port, proxy_host, proxy_port, user, password, use_ssl)
  For SSL you need the SSL package from RAA. 
* added full support for Introspection (only proc-handlers are supported)
* instance variables which value is  nil are not marshalled unless ENABLE_NIL_CREATE is true
* Marshallable classes need not have method initialize without arguments (adapted from SOAP4R)
* changed config.rb (made it simpler)
* added two flags ENABLE_MULTICALL and ENABLE_INTROSPECTION to config.rb

:1.6.5 (2001-06-21)
* modified multicall/multicall2 return value [1,2,3] instead of [[1], [2], [3]]
* CGIServer works now with FastCGI (see samples/xml.fcgi)
* renamed Server#stop to Server#shutdown
* added XMLRPC::Marshallable, to marshall any Ruby object to a hash and
  restore the object later from that hash.
* fixed bug where <value>  </value> was stripped to ""

:1.6.4 (2001-06-19)
* clients can use Symbol as type which is converted to a String
* added <nil/> (optionally) as well as BigInt (Bignum's > 32 bits)
* added configuration file (config.rb) for changing globally the parser/writer
  to use as well as which features to enable

:1.6.3 (2001-06-12)
* fixed default_handler bug
* added system.multicall extension
* added parser test-cases
* fixed bug: <value></value> was invalid (found by Thaddeus Covert)
* added Introspection (BasicServer#add_introspection) (by Neil Conway)
* added service-hook (which is called for each RPC)

:1.6.2 (2001-06-03)
* fixed bug; in create.rb XMLWrite::Simple did not escape text, thanx to Colin Steele
* a XMLRPC::Base64 object is no longer returned from a RPC, instead a Ruby String is returned.

:1.6.1
* changed HOWTO (added information on how to use NQXML)
* NQXML parser support
* possibility to choose between different XML parsers and XML writers, with
  Client#set_parser/#set_writer and BasicServer#set_parser/#set_writer
* added HTTP.version_1_1, so now works with Ruby versions > 1.7
* now you can do XML-RPC calls through a proxy server (Client.new).
  Thanks to Hiroshi.

:1.6
* added RAA (Ruby Application Archive) XML-RPC example TkRAA
* added XMLRPC::Client#proxy and #proxy2 as well as subclass Client::Proxy
* fixed another empty string bug, which occured when an empty name-tag (hash-key) was used.

: 1.5.4
* fixed empty string bug, thanks to NaHi

: 1.5.3
* added HOWTO
* XMLRPC::DateTime.new and all setter-methods, raise now an ArgumentError if the value is out of range

: 1.5.2 
* added Struct as possible type in a XMLRPC::Client#call/call2 or as a return value from a server-handler.

: 1.5.1
* now works also with Windows (validates)
* standalone-server (XMLRPC::Server) works correctly (changed \n to \r\n), and validates
* XMLRPC::Server.new has now a second paramter "host" to specify the host to listen on

: 1.5
* allow BigNum's that fit in 32-bit
* now, always check the parity of a method before calling it
* in server.rb, BasicServer#set/get_argument_error_handler removed
* in server.rb, BasicServer.new removed argument "check_parity", now always on
* introduced new type XMLRPC::DateTime to handle times which
  year is before 1970 (DateTime is now always returned, no more Date/Time)
* xmlrpc4r now validates to the validator1 test-suite
* added validator sample
* fixed a bug in parser, which causes the validator-suite to fail
* started writing ChangeLog
