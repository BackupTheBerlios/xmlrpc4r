XML-RPC for Ruby
Copyright (C) 2001 by Michael Neumann (neumann@s-direktnet.de)
License is the same as Ruby's

For more information about XML-RPC look at http://www.xmlrpc.com.


PREREQUISITES
-------------
You need xmlparser (I use version 0.6.1) from RAA, and 
a Ruby version >= 1.6.


INSTALL
-------
Type "ruby install.rb" in current directory.
Make sure you have root priviledges before you do this.

The XML-RPC library files are installed in your site_ruby directory,
of the actual ruby-version (e.g. "site_ruby/1.6") under the 
directory "xmlrpc".


SAMPLES
-------
I've included one example of an XML-RPC cgi-based server and
a ruby-program which calles it.
"samples/xml.cgi" is the cgi-based server, which should be placed
into your cgi-bin directory of your web-server.
"sampels/call.rb" is the client-side which calls the server (check 
the URL /cgi-bin/xml.cgi in samples/call.rb if it points to the cgi-based
server-script)

PROBLEMS
--------
Calling a remote procedure with a "Date" object, which is not in the range of
a Time object ( only values > 1970, IRC) it will fail. 
The same happens if a dateTime.iso8601 is returned from a remote procedure call 
which is not in this range.

Another problem is that XML-RPC do not specify the timezone. 
I use Time.gm(...) to create a Time object!


TODO
----
- add Date <-> Time conversions (see Problems) 
- write documentation
- convert from DOM to SAX ?
- declare exceptions (e.g. ParserException...)
- a Java XMLRPC implementation had <nil\>. should implement?
