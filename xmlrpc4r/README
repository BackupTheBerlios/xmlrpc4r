XML-RPC for Ruby
Copyright (C) 2001 by Michael Neumann (neumann@s-direktnet.de)

For more information about XML-RPC look at http://www.xmlrpc.com.


PREREQUISITES
-------------
You need xmlparser (I use version 0.6.1) from RAA, and 
a Ruby version >= 1.6.


INSTALL
-------
If you want to use XML-RPC (why not :) then you have to
create a new directory "xmlrpc" in your "site_ruby/1.6" 
(where 1.6 is your ruby-version) directory (on my computer 
this is in /usr/pkg/lib/ruby) and copy all files from the 
subdirectory "lib" into this (dir xmlrpc).
And of course you must have xmlparser installed.


SAMPLES
-------
I've included one example of an XML-RPC cgi-based server and
a ruby-program which calles it.
"samples/xml.cgi" is the cgi-based server, which should be placed
into your cgi-bin directory of your web-server.
"sampels/call.rb" is the client-side which calls the server (check 
the URL /cgi/xml.cgi in samples/call.rb if it points to the cgi-based
server-script)


TODO
----
- write documentation
- base64 type
- dateTime.iso8601 type
- convert from DOM to SAX ?
- declare exceptions (e.g. ParserException...)
